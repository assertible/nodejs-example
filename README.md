**[Tutorial: Set up a continuous testing pipeline with Node.js](https://assertible.com/blog/set-up-continuous-testing-with-nodejs)** 

This is an example of a complete continuous **integration**,
**delivery**, and **testing** pipeline using a Node.js app.  The
project demonstrates how you can integrate Assertible into your
deployment pipeline for running automated, post-deployment API tests.

## Introduction

A continuous integration and delivery pipeline makes teams and
developers more effective and building and deploying code. But many
teams haven't added continuous testing to their workflow, and resort
to manually testing applications after every deployment.

**The ideal workflow**

- Push code to GitHub
- Run unit tests and build the application on CircleCI
- Deploy the new application to Heroku
- Run post-deployment tests with Assertible

At Assertible, we've created a continuous testing platform to help
developers automate their QA tests and complete their CI pipeline.
